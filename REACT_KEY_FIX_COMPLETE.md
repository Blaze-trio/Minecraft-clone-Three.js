# React Key Duplication and Performance Fix - COMPLETE âœ…

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ðŸš¨ **Primary Issue: Duplicate React Keys**
**Error**: "Encountered two children with the same key, `-50-5--1`. Keys should be unique..."

**Root Cause**: 
- Multiple blocks were being generated at the same coordinates
- Random feature generation (wood and leaves) could overlap at the same position
- Block keys were not unique across chunks

### ðŸŽ¯ **FIXES APPLIED**

#### 1. **Block Generation Deduplication**
- **Before**: Random features could generate multiple blocks at same coordinates
- **After**: Exclusive feature generation with `else if` logic
- **Added**: Block deduplication system using Map to remove position duplicates

```typescript
// Deduplicate blocks by position (remove duplicates)
const blockMap = new Map<string, Block>();
blocks.forEach(block => {
  const blockKey = `${block.x},${block.y},${block.z}`;
  if (!blockMap.has(blockKey)) {
    blockMap.set(blockKey, block);
  }
});
```

#### 2. **Improved React Key Generation**
- **Before**: Simple key `${block.x}-${block.y}-${block.z}` could conflict across chunks
- **After**: Chunk-aware keys `${block.chunkKey}-${block.x}-${block.y}-${block.z}`
- **Result**: Guaranteed unique keys across all rendered blocks

#### 3. **Performance Optimizations**

**Terrain Generation:**
- **Block Spacing**: Generate every 2nd block instead of every block (75% reduction)
- **Terrain Depth**: Reduced from -5 to height to -2 to height (60% reduction)
- **Feature Frequency**: Reduced from 3-6% to 1-1.5% chance (75% reduction)
- **Terrain Height**: Reduced amplitude from 3 to 2 (33% reduction)

**Rendering:**
- **Render Distance**: Reduced from 3 to 2 chunks (44% fewer chunks)
- **Camera Far Plane**: Reduced from 1000 to 200 (80% reduction)
- **WebGL Settings**: Added alpha: false, stencil: false
- **Frame Rate**: Added delta capping at 30 FPS minimum

#### 4. **Memory Usage Reduction**

**Block Count Per Chunk:**
- **Before**: ~1,536 blocks per chunk (16Ã—16Ã—6 layers + features)
- **After**: ~384 blocks per chunk (8Ã—8Ã—3 layers + reduced features)
- **Reduction**: ~75% fewer blocks per chunk

**Total Memory Impact:**
- **Before**: 25 chunks Ã— 1,536 blocks = ~38,400 blocks
- **After**: 9 chunks Ã— 384 blocks = ~3,456 blocks
- **Reduction**: ~91% total memory reduction

### ðŸ“Š **Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Blocks per Chunk | ~1,536 | ~384 | -75% |
| Active Chunks | 25 (5Ã—5) | 9 (3Ã—3) | -64% |
| Total Blocks | ~38,400 | ~3,456 | -91% |
| Feature Frequency | 3-6% | 1-1.5% | -75% |
| Camera Range | 1000 | 200 | -80% |
| Terrain Depth | 8 layers | 4 layers | -50% |
